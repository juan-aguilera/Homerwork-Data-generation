Project Title: Generating Realistic Financial Data

Introduction

Welcome to the project repository for generating realistic financial data! This project aims to provide a platform for generating synthetic financial data that closely resembles real-world data from companies listed on the S&P 500. The generated data includes various attributes such as company location, founding year, sector classification, EIN (Employer Identification Number), financial performance metrics, and trading indicators like current price, volume, shareholder percentage, etc.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a dataset that mimics real financial data found in the industry. By generating synthetic data resembling actual data, students can practice algorithm development, data analysis, and modeling in a realistic environment.

Requirements
To ensure the quality and usefulness of this project, the following minimal requirements have been met:

Public Repository: The project is hosted on GitHub as a public repository, providing easy access to the source code and documentation.

Test Driven Development: The project follows Test Driven Development (TDD) principles, achieving at least 90% test coverage to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

Data Generation: The project generates synthetic financial data, including a table with approximately 30 columns. The row count is variable, allowing for scalability.

Unique Key: At least one column in the generated dataset serves as a unique key to ensure data integrity.

Realism: The generated data exhibits minimal resemblance to real-world financial data, providing a realistic environment for algorithm development and analysis.

Expert Validation: While no external experts have validated the generated data, the project maintainer has significant expertise as a futures trader and possesses in-depth knowledge of financial metrics and trading indicators. Leveraging this expertise, the project maintainer has meticulously designed the dataset to closely resemble real-world financial data found in the industry.


Usage
This project is intended for use by students enrolled in algorithm classes. By utilizing the generated financial dataset, students can practice algorithm development, data analysis, and modeling in a simulated real-world context.
